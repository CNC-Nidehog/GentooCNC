Gentoo CNC:
===========

Is a Gentoo based Linux distribution designed to support hard
real-time control of equipment such as industrial machine tools, 3D
printers, laser cutters, robots, and coordinate measuring machines
using LinuxCNC.  GentooCNC is designed to target embedded platforms
such as the BeagleBone, Mini2440, as well as conventional desktop
platforms.


Installing overlay:
-------------------

Currently, GentooCNC is not added into official Gentoo overlay list,
as it's not stable enough yet. This implies that it's not available 
through layman.

To use our overlay, you have to manually point downloaded overlay 
directory in PORTDIR_OVERLAY. Open your make.conf file and add:
    

PORTDIR_OVERLAY="${PORTDIR_OVERLAY} /home/you/gentoocnc/overlay"
